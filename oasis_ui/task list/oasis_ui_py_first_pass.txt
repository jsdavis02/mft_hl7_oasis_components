Slow as shit on a cold shingle - fixed for now

Major function: export/import routes/endpoints that bundles

Route properties, same as Endpoint, necessary? if I wanted to change properties - like env, I rather do it in intellij where I can highlight a bunch of rows one shot and commit

Add endpoint/route are missing dropdowns for stuff we need to config - do we still need the HL7 checkbox stuff on the route stuff?

Add endpoint property - clicking on endpoint "properties" link and then add property -- makes you choose the endpoint you just came from -- and again, no dropdown for property names and no help verbiage

Views need massive look and feel make over - nothing stands out visually to me

Admin dashboard missing w/ endpoint, route, audit counts

Can we duplicate endpoints? Can we code up the duplicate route we didn't before?

Endpoint properties view seems unnecessary, rather drill into this stuff to be sure I know what I would be changing

Reorder endpoint change/add properties to match old UI
